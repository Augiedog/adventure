looking for help with a new project, I want to make a choose your own adventure book style adventure using reactJS. I already have a story and my daughters are making the art. I'm looking for guidance with app structure and code.

That’s an awesome project 🥹 — interactive story + your kids’ art + React is a chef’s kiss combo. I’m happy to help you design this in a way that’s clean, flexible, and fun to extend.

Let’s break this into architecture, data modeling, and React patterns, then I’ll give you a concrete starting code example you can build on.

1. High-level app structure (mental model)
Think of your app as having three layers:

Story data

Pure JSON (or JS objects)

No React inside it

Describes pages, choices, and outcomes

State engine

Tracks where the reader is in the story

Handles choosing paths, resetting, etc.

UI components

Displays text

Displays art

Renders choices as buttons

This separation keeps the story editable without touching React logic.

2. Story data model (this is the most important part)
A good CYOA structure is a directed graph.

Each “page” (node) has:

id

text

image

choices[] → each choice points to another page

Example: story.js
const story = {
  start: "forest-entrance",

  pages: {
    "forest-entrance": {
      text: "You stand at the edge of a dark forest. A path splits in two.",
      image: "/art/forest-entrance.png",
      choices: [
        {
          label: "Take the left path",
          next: "left-path"
        },
        {
          label: "Take the right path",
          next: "right-path"
        }
      ]
    },

    "left-path": {
      text: "The trees grow closer together. You hear a strange noise.",
      image: "/art/left-path.png",
      choices: [
        {
          label: "Investigate the noise",
          next: "monster"
        },
        {
          label: "Run away",
          next: "forest-entrance"
        }
      ]
    },

    "monster": {
      text: "A friendly monster appears and offers you a cookie.",
      image: "/art/monster.png",
      choices: []
    }
  }
};

export default story;
💡 Key idea:
The story is just data. You could later:

Swap stories

Add flags

Add inventory

Add randomness

…without rewriting your UI.

3. Core React state
At minimum, your app needs:

const [currentPageId, setCurrentPageId] = useState(story.start);
That’s it. The whole adventure is driven by that one value.

4. Component breakdown
Here’s a clean, beginner-friendly structure:

src/
  App.jsx
  story.js
  components/
    StoryPage.jsx
    ChoiceButton.jsx
App.jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import story from "./story";
import StoryPage from "./components/StoryPage";

function App() {
  const [currentPageId, setCurrentPageId] = useState(story.start);

  const currentPage = story.pages[currentPageId];

  const handleChoice = (nextPageId) => {
    setCurrentPageId(nextPageId);
  };

  return (
    <div className="app">
      <StoryPage page={currentPage} onChoose={handleChoice} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
StoryPage.jsx
import ChoiceButton from "./ChoiceButton";

function StoryPage({ page, onChoose }) {
  return (
    <div className="story-page">
      {page.image && (
        <img
          src={page.image}
          alt=""
          className="story-image"
        />
      )}

      <p className="story-text">{page.text}</p>

      <div className="choices">
        {page.choices.length === 0 ? (
          <p>The End</p>
        ) : (
          page.choices.map((choice, index) => (
            <ChoiceButton
              key={index}
              label={choice.label}
              onClick={() => onChoose(choice.next)}
            />
          ))
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default StoryPage;
ChoiceButton.jsx
function ChoiceButton({ label, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button className="choice-button" onClick={onClick}>
      {label}
    </button>
  );
}

export default ChoiceButton;
5. Art handling (kid-proof 😄)
Best options:

Put images in /public/art/

Reference them by filename in the story data

That way:

Your daughters can replace images without touching code

You don’t need to import every asset manually

6. Natural next features (when you’re ready)
Once the basic version works, you can level it up:

🌱 Flags / decisions
choices: [
  {
    label: "Help the monster",
    next: "reward",
    setFlag: "helpedMonster"
  }
]
🎒 Inventory
inventory: ["magic key"]
🔄 Restart button
setCurrentPageId(story.start);
💾 Save progress
localStorage.setItem("page", currentPageId);
7. How I’d suggest we continue
If you want, we can:

Design a story editor format (so you can write stories fast)

Add animations / page transitions

Add branch conditions (“only show this choice if…”)

Add sound effects

Make it mobile-first for tablets

👉 Next good question for you:
Do you want this to feel more like:

📖 a book (one page at a time, minimal UI), or

🎮 a game (stats, inventory, visible choices, replayability)?

Either direction is totally doable — just slightly different architecture choices.
